# Arduino-Scheduler

### What's this?
A physical scheduler device built on an arduino. I use it to follow my timetable and create some semblance of organization in my life.

### Description
Formatted schedules can be loaded into an SD card.<br />
The scheduler will parse the schedule and display relevant information on a liquid crystal display.<br />
When the time comes for a new event to initiate the arduino will raise an alarm, in the form of a flashing LED, <br />
which needs to be disarmed via button as indication of acknowledgement.<br />

Schedules are saved on formatted txt files. See example..?<br />
By default, the schedule loops on a weekly basis but deviations can be made by adding a specifically dated schedule in the SD card.<br />
